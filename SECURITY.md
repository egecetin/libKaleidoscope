## Reporting a Vulnerability :closed_lock_with_key: :eyes:

You can use the GitHub issues to report a vulnerability publicly. There is no private vulnerability reporting system and disclose policy. But if you find a sensitive security issue and want to report privately :lock:, please email <egecetin@hotmail.com.tr>. If you already looked at the code and found the root cause - that's great :four_leaf_clover:! You can create a GitHub pull request as soon as possible with fix to keep safe everyone.
